# Project-Diva
A reimplementation of Project Diva (or atleast a part of it) in V!

# Endgoal
To be able to play the game natively on any system (that is supported by V).

# State of the Project
[[> Refer to the TODO](TODO.md)]

# Disclaimer [Windows only]
The BinaryReader in Windows, for whatever reason, works much worse than it is on *nix. Not sure why that is. <br>
Linux will be the main target of this project.

- [farc-rust](https://github.com/diva-rust-modding/farc), somewhat barebone version of the farc, but enough to give me clues on how the archive file works.
